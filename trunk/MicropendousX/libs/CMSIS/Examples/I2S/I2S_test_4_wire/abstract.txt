
Purpose:
	This is an example to test I2S 4-wire mode. 
	I2S Receiver is set in 4-wire mode, sharing the Transmitter bit clock and WS.
	I2S configuration:
			- wordwidth: 16 bits
	  		- stereo mode
	  		- Frequency = 44.1 kHz (x=8,y=51 - automatic setting)	 
	Using UART0 with this configuration:
			– 115200bps 
			– 8 data bit
			– No parity 
			– 1 stop bit 
			– No flow control 
	
Hardware configuration:
	This example tested on Keil MCB1700 with LPC1768 ver.1
	These jumpers must be configured as following:
	- VDDIO, VDDREGS, VBUS must be closed.
	
	Pin I2SRX_SDA(P0.4) connect with pin I2STX_SDA(P0.9)
	
Running mode:
	This example can run on RAM mode or FLASH after burning.
