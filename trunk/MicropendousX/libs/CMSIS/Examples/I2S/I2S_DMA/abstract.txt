Purpose:
	This is a simple example for I2S with DMA support:
	We use 2 I2S channels: I2S Transmit & Receive channel in the same kit to communicate each other.
	I2S configuration:
			- wordwidth: 16 bits
	  		- stereo mode
	  		- master mode for I2S_TX and slave for I2S_RX
	  		- Frequency = 44.1 kHz (x=8,y=51 - automatic setting)	 
	Using UART0 with this configuration:
			– 115200bps 
			– 8 data bit
			– No parity 
			– 1 stop bit 
			– No flow control 
	
Hardware configuration:
	This example tested on Keil MCB1700 with LPC1768 ver.1
	These jumpers must be configured as following:
	- VDDIO, VDDREGS, VBUS must be closed.
	
	- P0.4(J.116) connect to P0.7(J.112)
	- P0.5(J.115) connect to P0.8(J.111)
	- P0.6(J.113) connect to p0.9(J.109)
	
Running mode:
	This example can run on RAM mode with a debugger or on FLASH after burning.
	
Note:
	- When I2S start, there are some dummy data 0x00 will be send while FIFO transmit empty, but I2S is used to transmit and 
	receive audio data, so these data are not important and can be ignored.
