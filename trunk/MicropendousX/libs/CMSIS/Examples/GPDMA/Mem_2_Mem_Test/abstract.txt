
Purpose:
	This example will transfer 2 block of data from memory boundary (AHBRAM1_BASE - USB RAM)
	to the other memory boundary on RAM using GPDMA module with interrupt.
	Using UART0 with this configuration – 115200bps – 8 data bit – No parity – 1 stop bit 
	– No flow control to display information.

Hardware configuration:
	This example tested on Keil MCB1700 with LPC1768 ver.1
	These jumpers must be configured as following:
		- VDDIO, VDDREGS, VBUS must be closed.

Running mode:
	This example can run on RAM mode with a debugger or run on FLASH after burning.
	
Note:
	None
