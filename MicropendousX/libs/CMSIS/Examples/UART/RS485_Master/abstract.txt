
Purpose:
		This example used to test RS485 functionality on UART1 of
	LPC1768.
		In this case, RS485 function on UART1 acts as Master mode on
	RS485 bus.
		Master device will send a specified slave device address value
	first, then master device will send data frames. After sending
	complete, master device wait for response from slave device.
		UART0 (115.2Kbps - 8N1) is used to display information during
	RS485 operation of Master device.

Hardware configuration:
	This example tested on Keil MCB2300 platform v4.0 with LPC1768
	These jumpers must be configured as following:
		- VBUS must be closed.
		- All remaining jumpers must be opened.
		About the RS485 transceiver wiring, see the 'Transceiver_Master.png' 
		in this directory.

Running mode:
	This example can run on RAM mode with a debugger or run on FLASH.
	
Note:
	The RS485 slave device must initialize first.
