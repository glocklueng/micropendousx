
Purpose:
	This example uses two SSP peripherals in TI frame format,
	one is set as master mode and the other is set as slave mode.
	The master and slave transfer a number of data bytes together
	in interrupt mode.
	UART0 – 115200bps – 8 data bit – No parity – 1 stop bit – No flow control.
	
Hardware configuration:
	This example tested on Keil MCB1700 vers.1
	These jumpers must be configured as following:
		- VDDIO, VDDREGS, VBUS, LED, must be closed.
		
	SSP0 and SSP1 Connectivity:
		- P0.15 <-> P0.7 : SCK
	 	- P0.16 <-> P0.6 : SSEL 
	  	- P0.17 <-> P0.8 : MISO
	  	- P0.18 <-> P0.9 : MOSI
		
Running mode:
	This example can run on RAM mode with a debugger or run on FLASH.
	
Note:
	None
