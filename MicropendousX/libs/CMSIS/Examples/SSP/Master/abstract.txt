
Purpose:
	An example of SSP using Polling mode to test the SSP driver.
	This example uses SSP in SPI frame as master to communicate
	with an SSP slave device.
	The master and slave transfer together a number of data byte.
	UART0 – 115200bps – 8 data bit – No parity – 1 stop bit – No flow control.
	
Hardware configuration:
	This example tested on Keil MCB1700 vers.1
	These jumpers must be configured as following:
		- VDDIO, VDDREGS, VBUS, LED, must be closed.
		
	SSP Connectivity:
		- P0.15 - SCK;
	 	- P0.16 - SSEL 
	  	- P0.17 - MISO
	  	- P0.18 - MOSI
	Common ground must be connected together between two board.
		
Running mode:
	This example can run on RAM mode with a debugger or run on FLASH.
	
Note:
	None
