
Purpose:
	This example uses SSP function in MASTER mode
	with Loop-back mode (MOSI <-> MISO).
	Transfer a number of data byte (in DMA mode for both Tx and Rx channel)
	UART0 – 115200bps – 8 data bit – No parity – 1 stop bit – No flow control.
	
Hardware configuration:
	This example tested on Keil MCB1700 vers.1
	These jumpers must be configured as following:
		- VDDIO, VDDREGS, VBUS, LED, must be closed.
		
	SSP Connectivity:
		- P0.15 - SCK;
	 	- P0.16 - SSEL 
	  	- P0.17 - MISO
	  	- P0.18 - MOSI
	MOSI pin must be connected with MISO pin.
		
Running mode:
	This example can run on RAM mode with a debugger or run on FLASH.
	
Note:
	None
