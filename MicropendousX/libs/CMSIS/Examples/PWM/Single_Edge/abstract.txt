
Purpose:
	This is a simple example about PWM function on LPC17xx.
	This program illustrates the PWM signal on 6 Channels in single edge mode
		 Peripheral clock for PWM: PWM_PCLK = CCLK / 4 = 72MHz/4 = 18MHz and there is no
		 prescale for PWM. The PWM timer/counter clock is at 18MHz. The base rate is set to 256
		 The base PWM frequency is at 18MHz/256 = 70.312 KHz (Period = ~14.22 microsecond)
		 Each PWM channel (1 to 6) will be configured as following:
		 + PWM1.1 = (10/256) (period = 0.56 microsecond)
		 + PWM1.2 = (20/256) (period = 1.11 microsecond)
		 + PWM1.3 = (30/256) (period = 1.67 microsecond)
		 + PWM1.4 = (40/256) (period = 2.22 microsecond)
		 + PWM1.5 = (50/256) (period = 2.78 microsecond)
		 + PWM1.6 = (60/256) (period = 3.33 microsecond)
		 Using Oscilloscope to observe the PWM signals
	Using UART0 with this configuration – 115200bps – 8 data bit – No parity – 1 stop bit – No flow control 
	to display this conversion.

Hardware configuration:
	This example tested on Keil MCB1700 with LPC1768 ver.1
	These jumpers must be configured as following:
	- VDDIO, VDDREGS, VBUS, LED must be closed.

Running mode:
	This example can run on RAM mode with a debugger or run on FLASH after burning.
