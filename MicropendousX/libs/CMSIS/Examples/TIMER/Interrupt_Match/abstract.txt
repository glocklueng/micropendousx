Purpose:
	This is a simple example to test TIMER in interrupt mode.
	Use timer 0 to turn on/off P2.0 and toggle MAT0.0(pin P1.28) at frequency 10Hz.
	Using UART0 with this configuration – 115200bps – 8 data bit – No parity – 1 stop bit – No flow control 
	

Hardware configuration:
	This example tested on Keil MCB1700 vers.1
	These jumpers must be configured as following:
		- VDDIO, VDDREGS, VBUS, LED must be closed.

Running mode:
	This example can run on RAM mode with a debugger or run on FLASH after burning.
	
Note:
	None
