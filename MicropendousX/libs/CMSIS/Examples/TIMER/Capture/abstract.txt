
Purpose:
	This example used to test Capture Timer function.
	We use Timer 0 to take a snapshot of the timer value when an input signal on CAP0.0 (pin P1.26) transitions.
	Changing connect P0.26 with GND and VCC continuously to capture time.
	Using UART0 with this configuration – 115200bps – 8 data bit – No parity – 1 stop bit – No flow control 
	

Hardware configuration:
	This example tested on Keil MCB1700 vers.1
	These jumpers must be configured as following:
		- VDDIO, VDDREGS, VBUS, LED must be closed.

Running mode:
	This example can run on RAM mode with a debugger or run on FLASH after burning.
	
Note:
	None
