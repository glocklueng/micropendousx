
Purpose:
	An example of I2C using polling mode to test the I2C driver.
	Using I2C at mode I2C master/8bit on LPC1768 to communicate with
	SC16IS750/760 Demo Board.
	UART0 – 115200bps – 8 data bit – No parity – 1 stop bit – No flow control.

Hardware configuration:
	This example tested on Keil MCB1700 with LPC1768 ver.1
	These jumpers must be configured as following:
		- VDDIO, VDDREGS, VBUS must be closed.
		
		This example use only one I2C peripheral to test.
		For I2C0:
		- SDA0 -> P0.27
		- SCL0 -> P0.28
		For I2C2:
		- SDA2 -> P0.10
		- SCL2 -> P0.11
		Common ground must be connected together between two board.
		
Running mode:
	This example can run on RAM mode with a debugger or run on FLASH.
	
Note:
	None
