
Purpose:
	This example will test Quadrature Encoder Interface module in LPC17xx
	with velocity calculation (RPM) to display via UART0.
	Using UART0 with this configuration – 115200bps – 8 data bit – No parity – 1 stop bit 
	– No flow control to display information.

Hardware configuration:
	This example tested on Keil MCB1700 with LPC1768 ver.1
	These jumpers must be configured as following:
	- VDDIO, VDDREGS, VBUS, LED must be closed.

Running mode:
	This example can run on RAM mode with a debugger or run on FLASH after burning.
	
Note:
	This example use a timer match interrupt to generate a virtual QEI signal output for QEI 
	module to capture (Phase A and Phase B channel). In case of using QEI virtual signal, 
	symbol VIRTUAL_QEI_SIGNAL must be set to 1. In this case, two GPIO output pin on port 0 
	can be used	to toggle state that defined through PHASE_A_PIN and PHASE_B_PIN. The MCFB0 
	(PHA - Phase A input) and MCFB1 (PHB - Phase B input) therefore must be connect to these GPIO  pins.
