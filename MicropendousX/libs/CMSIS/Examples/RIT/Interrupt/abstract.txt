
Purpose:
	This is a simple RIT example: use RIT as a timer to generate interrupt to drive LED2.2
	Using UART0 with this configuration 
		– 115200bps 
		– 8 data bit 
		– No parity 
		– 1 stop bit 
		– No flow control 
	
Hardware configuration:
	This example tested on Keil MCB1700 with LPC1768 ver.1
	These jumpers must be configured as following:
	- VDDIO, VDDREGS, VBUS, LED must be closed.
		
Running mode:
	This example can run on RAM mode with a debugger or run on FLASH after burning.
	
Note:
	None
