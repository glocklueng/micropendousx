The 'UART' project is a simple program for the LPC1766 
using Keil 'MCB2300' Evaluation Board and demonstrating 
the use of UART0 in both polling and interrupt driven mode.

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL    =            	12.00 MHz
   - SYSCLK  =           	72.00 MHz
   - PCLK    = SYSCLK/4 = 	18.00 MHz

 - Program is used to read a character and to print out a string.
   115200 Baud, 1 Stop Bit, 8 Data Bits, No Flow Control
 
The Uart program can run from Internal RAM located on chip
(target debugging)



-- CMSIS ---------------------------------------------
UartDev:
  - only one interface is available
  - no FlowControl


UartDev_LPC17xx:
  - only one UART is used
  - UART          selected via compiler switch
  - UART pins     selected via compiler switch

  - bufferHandling is configured via compiler switch
  - polling or interrupt driven I/O is configured via compiler switch

Note: 
 - remove ISP and RST jumper for UART0 to work properly
